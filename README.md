# CI/CD ML Pipeline for Census Bureau Salary Classification Using GitHub Actions, FastAPI and Heroku

**Project description:** In this project, we will be deploying an end to end CI/CD pipeline salary classification web app using scikit-learn, GitHub actions, FastAPI and Heroku. The pipeline classifies the salaries of citizens based on a census bureau dataset. The focus on the project is on the CI/CD pipeline and MLOps process to quickly test and deploy revisions of the model while modelling takes a back seat.
